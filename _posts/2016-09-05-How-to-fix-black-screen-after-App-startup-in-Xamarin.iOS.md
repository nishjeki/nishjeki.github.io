Black screen appears after App startup while using story board as:

<img src="{{site.url}}/images/blackscreen-after-app_start-in-storyboard.png"/>

The Application output in Xamarin Studio clearly states:

> The app delegate must implement the window property if it wants to use a main storyboard file.

Hence to fix : Go to your AppDelegate class and override the Window property as:

```cs
public partial class AppDelegate : UIApplicationDelegate
{
	public override UIWindow Window
	{
		get;
		set;
	}
```

And thatâ€™s it!
