I recently purchased a Macbook Pro - MD101 (2012 Model).  Well, it is quite an old model, but considering the price and upgradeability, its best suited for my need.  I got it for Rs. 61,499 on flipkart.com.

I'm a C# .NET developer.  I tried searching for some video review for .NET development. Couldnt find one online, so created one using it and uploaded on [youtube](http://youtu.be/tVXLtbCOI7o).

I think the machine is sufficient when developing for the Mac or iOS only.  But it will need some more RAM when using virtual boxes and cross-platform development.  It's easy to upgrade so shouldn't be a problem.
