<p class="message">
  I'm 'Nitin Pakhide'. After working as a software developer for nearly 12 years in private limited company environments, I decided to take an experience in the Open world. And here I'm as an Open-source software developer.
  Thanks to my wife 'Shikha' for all the support and love of our kids 'Jenisha' and 'Kitik'.
